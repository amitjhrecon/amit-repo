        A string value having a meaning that helps to distinguish
        a group of services, for example the domain name that
        includes a group of services. service.name is expected to be
        unique within the same namespace. If service.namespace is
        not specified in the Resource then service.name is expected
        to be unique for all services that have no explicit namespace
        defined (so the empty/unspecified namespace is simply one
        more valid namespace). Zero-length namespace string is assumed
        equal to unspecified namespace.

      description: |
        MUST be unique for each instance of the same
        service.namespace,service.name pair (in other words
        service.namespace,service.name,service.instance.id triplet
        MUST be globally unique). The ID helps to distinguish instances
        of the same service that exist at the same time (e.g. instances
        of a horizontally scaled service). It is preferable for the ID
        to be persistent and stay the same for the lifetime of the
        service instance, however it is acceptable that the ID is
        ephemeral and changes during important lifetime events for the
        service (e.g. service restarts). If the service has no inherent
        unique ID that can be used as the value of this attribute it is
        recommended to generate a random Version 1 or Version 4 RFC
        4122 UUID (services aiming for reproducible UUIDs may also use
        Version 5, see RFC 4122 for more recommendations).
